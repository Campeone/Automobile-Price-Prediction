# Automobile Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview
This project performs regression analysis to predict the prices of automobiles based on various features such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately estimate the price of a car using linear regression techniques. The project demonstrates both simple and multiple linear regression approaches.

```

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to automobiles, including:
- **Make**: The brand of the car
- **Fuel Type**: The type of fuel used (e.g., gas, diesel)
- **Engine Size**: The size of the car's engine
- **Horsepower**: The power of the engine
- **Price**: The price of the car (target variable)

- **Source**: [Link to dataset if available]
- **Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## Modeling
The following steps were performed for the regression analysis:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
    - Visualization of data distributions and relationships between features.
    - Handling of missing data and outliers.

2. **Simple Linear Regression**:
    - A model predicting the car price based on a single feature (e.g., engine size).

3. **Multiple Linear Regression**:
    - A model incorporating multiple features like engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and more.

4. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluation metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.

## Results
- Best model: **Multiple Linear Regression**
- Key findings:
    - Features such as engine size, horsepower, and fuel type have a significant impact on car prices.
    - The model achieved an R-squared score of [insert value].

- Performance metrics:
    - **MAE**: [insert value]
    - **MSE**: [insert value]
    - **R-squared**: [insert value]

Visualizations:
- Scatter plots showing actual vs predicted prices.
- Residual plots to analyze errors.

## Usage
To make predictions with the trained model, use the following command:
```bash
python src/predict.py --input data/new_car_data.csv
```

Example of predictions:
```
| Engine Size | Horsepower | Fuel Type | Predicted Price |
|-------------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 2.0L        | 130        | Gas       | $15,000         |
| 3.5L        | 200        | Diesel    | $25,000         |
```

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict automobile prices. The multiple linear regression model provided better results than the simple linear regression model, emphasizing the importance of incorporating multiple features. Future work could include feature engineering, polynomial regression, or incorporating regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression.
